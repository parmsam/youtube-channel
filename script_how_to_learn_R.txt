How to learn R?

It can be challenging to learn a new programming language, especially when you are starting from scratch with no prior experience.
I had taken a course in Python prior to learning R, which massively helped me out when I started learning R.

The intent of this video is to provide an brief overview of tools that you can use as of [INSERT CURRENT DATE HERE] to learn R.
I've tried to mention general categories and then specific examples that have worked for me.

The categories listed may apply to learning a new programming language in general.

I feel it's helpful to have with diverse streams of information when learning something new. So without further ado lets begin.

1) Online courses
	- Coursera
2) Interactive Online Courses
	- Datacamp
	- Dataquest
4) Programming Books
	- R for data science by Hadley Wickham
	- Advanced R by Hadley Wickham
	- Text mining with R
5) Blogs
	- R vuews blog from rstudio
	- Check out Rweekly which aggregates many blogs, tutorials, and resources
	- Other blogs
6) Join a learning community or forum
	- facebook groups which can find via search feature in FB
	- Join your local Meetup group
	- Ask questions on stack overflow
	- github learning communities like r for data science learning community
7) Read source code or other projects on Github
	- Follow your favorite R programmer on Github
8) Coding challenges and competitions
	- Local hackathon or data challenge with a group of friends
	- TidyTuesday
9) Find publically available datasets
	- Kaggle
10) Watch other people coding videos
	- David Robinson streaming himself coding for Tidytuesday
	- Twitch (mostly not in R, but the principle still applies)

Lastly, I've included a general list of resources that I've used in the past year or two in varying degrees.
I try to keep it updated for friends and family.
