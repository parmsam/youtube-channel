Why learn R?

With so many programming languages available to learn, why should you learn R?
This question depends on your field and your professional network.
 -Do you have any friends or colleagues that are using R? What is their experience?
 -Have they recommended that you learn R? If so why?
These are more questions you can ask yourself before starting a journey to learn this new programming language.
One primary question that people might ask themselves is "What are the benefits?
Generally, there are several advantages to learning R.
1) Growing popularity
	- still a hot new thing for alot of folks especially in the field data science. You can see this in data from indeed, kaggle, or stack overflow.
		- second most popular programming language for DS or ML tasks behind Python
	- more people coding in the language has meant more needs identification and more package development to solve needs in R
	- more package development resulting in lower barrier to entry as the many tools are freely available for people to use
