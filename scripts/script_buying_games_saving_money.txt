Focus of this video is on resources to check out before buying a video games. 

First of all the easiest way to probably save money and time in some cases is not to buy video games. This depends on your situation. However that statement ignores the stress relieving effect that video games or any hobby, sport, or form of entertainment can have on people. It can improve general productivity and happiness by giving people a break. Keep in mind the good and the bad of any hobby. Balance is key.

Tips on personal finance and video games (some of these steps can be moved around). 
Personal reflection phase
---x---
1. Ask yourself if you need it (I do this with every purchase).
	- as you get older you'll probably have less time due to more responsibilities
	- make sure you have a sufficient justification
	- do I have time to play the video game?
		- time spent playing is time potentially spent on other priorities
	- do I have the money (think of money spent as a time-cost)?
		- not spending money is a great way to save money (ignore investing here)
		- does this fit into my budget
	- will it make me happy or releave stress?
		- will it add to my stress?
2. Do you care if the video game is a physical or digital version (yes or no)?
	- think about the resale/trade value that the physical version would have
3. If okay with a physical copy, then are you okay with a used copy of the video game (yes or no)?
	- you can sometimes save a few bucks and get a used copy from Gamestop, Amazon, etc.
4. If okay with physical copy, are you okay with renting a copy of the video game (yes or no)?
	- gamefly (https://www.gamefly.com/games), redbox (https://www.redbox.com/), etc.
5. If okay with physical copy, can you borrow a copy from a friend (old school) or a library (yes or no)?

Data collection phase

6. Is it something you will enjoy playing
	- check out video game reviews (be careful to avoid spoilers)
		- ACG (https://www.youtube.com/user/AngryCentaurGaming)
		- IGN (https://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment)
		- steam reviews
		- google reviews
	- I assume you're buying the video game to play not collect
7. Get an idea of the current and historical price
	- check out Amazon, physical game stores (Gamestop, Bestbuy, etc), and PC game stores
		- this is to get an idea of the current price
	- also check out humblebundle (https://www.humblebundle.com/)
	- use a price tracker
		- camelcamelcamel is the price tracker I use for amazon (https://camelcamelcamel.com/)
		- steamdb for steam games https://steamdb.info/ 
8. Is there a sale going on or coming up?
	- steam gamestore has spring, summer, halloween, black friday, and winter game sales
	- epic gamestore is giving out weekly free games and a bunch of sales similar to steam
		- also giving out free coupons during these sales
	- other seasonal or holiday sales at physical stores
	- alternatively, target has a 5% discount with their redcard

Decision phase

9. Ask yourself one more time if you need it (see step 1).
10. If you get to this step and still want it, then just buy it.
